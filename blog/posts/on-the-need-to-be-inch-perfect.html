        <p>There were two situations I observed in the last couple of days that reminded me of this annoying dilemma with product building and how we get lost in our sauce sometimes. 
<strong>The first</strong> is the situation with Paystack that seemingly went under the radar (honestly, if it were a different product, the reactions would have been vastly different). 
<strong>The second</strong> is an acquaintance complaining about the wording of an edge case of a fintech tool that is (was- this will depend on if its actually fixed like the promised) very badly worded AND passive aggressive.</p>
<p>These two situations reminded me of the two dilemmas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need to be perfect by the end user</li>
<li>The need to seem perfect by the builder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both WILL get you in trouble (I use this incredibly lightly unless you are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-to-do-with-your-humane-ai-pin/#:~:text=As%20of%20today%2C%20the%20Humane,Let's%20explore.">Humane ai pin</a> i guess) as someone that builds product, one is truly within your control.</p>
<p>The answer to the one is "the need to seem perfect by the builder". The basic idea here is that you should <strong>THROW</strong> out the door the idea to be perfect and plan for imperfections the way you plan for perfection (basically the happy path within your product).</p>
<p>Learnt this lesson while doing product at Carbon. One of our first core ideas with attaching a product person (i.e me- as the scape goat) to customer success is identifying the themes and patterns of issues that are as a result of things outside of our control. Basically pro-active customer support. We know what the failure points can be, heck we had designs for error states. How you show up for the end user at that point does a lot more to build good will than the frustrations they faced. You can find the common issues and design what the experience should look like from a customer happiness perspective (you know their happy points and you DEFINITELY know their common sad points). The metrics showed good health in customer happiness, end users were in most cases (not all, some people enjoy staying mad and that is alright) happier and informed (keyword here is informed) which makes their situation seem less dire.</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>This is directed straight at the builder, you will never be perfect and that is alright, you will however be good for most of the time and that will boil down to how and when you speak when you are not perfect to your end users. For the most part, it can be predicted and planned for (which will build you goodwill for when you have situations you have not predicted).</p>
<p>Ciao!</p>
