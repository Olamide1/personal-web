We have seen a lot of talk about AI writing/scripting (it exists in video content also) and the use of certain words or phrasing with how it writes. For me, it feels mostly like an over reaction that is leading to an over-correction of how we consume other people's thoughts in written form. I also have a bit of a gripe with it but for very different reasons- The use of the rhetorical device called the "not-but" structure that is a combination of **[antithesis](https://www.google.com/search?q=antithesis&oq=antithesis&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)** and **[via negativa](https://www.google.com/search?q=via+negativa+rhetoric+device&sca_esv=903e5a2d5ddaaca0&sxsrf=ANbL-n4Dg16znqVakc9WPzfPnxq9GLJS1w:1768557440747&ei=gAtqaaemLaHLi-gPjOjO0QE&ved=0ahUKEwin5pTw5Y-SAxWh5QIHHQy0MxoQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=via+negativa+rhetoric+device&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiHHZpYSBuZWdhdGl2YSByaGV0b3JpYyBkZXZpY2UyBxAhGKABGAoyBxAhGKABGApIt05QygZYpk1wAngBkAEAmAGrAaAB2hiqAQQwLjI2uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIYoALVFcICChAAGLADGNYEGEfCAgQQIxgnwgIGEAAYFhgewgILEAAYgAQYhgMYigXCAggQABiABBiiBMICBRAAGO8FwgIFEAAYgATCAgoQABiABBgUGIcCwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAgUQLhiABMICBRAhGKABwgIHEAAYgAQYDcICBhAAGA0YHsICCBAAGAgYDRgewgIFECEYnwWYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwQyLjIyoAevjgGyBwQwLjIyuAfNFcIHBjIuMTQuOMgHQYAIAA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)**.

The problem tho (yes, I used this version of tho instead of the longer one, its for in-formal use and I like it, move on), is that that is the LLMs way of attempting impact and importance. Human beings don't write like that, heck we don't even think like that. We start from what we know to identify what we don't. Maybe watch out for that. We don't start statements or thoughts by saying "a, and b did not have x, y, z because of l, m or p" We start by saying what the issue is. That is what stands out and rubs us the wrong way when we see LLM produced content. I don't think the problem is using an LLM to optimize or make your work better, its how its being used. 

We are seeing it in scripts for videos and writings. Honestly, I am over it. If you are going to use an LLM to do your work, edit the work, let is be a starting point and not the entirety of your work.\

Do better.
