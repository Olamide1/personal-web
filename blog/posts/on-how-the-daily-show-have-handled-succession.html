        <p>The daily show is one of my favorite shows/channels on Youtube (yes, I watch a lot of Youtube, I think its an incredible expression of creative talent hat normal people like myself have been able to achieve), but I stopped actively watching the daily show after Trevor Noah left. I don't even have any particular reason but I realized a slow decline in my Youtube searches being The daily show and for some reason Youtube has stopped recommending newer episodes to me.</p>
<p>I did start catching some glimpses of it via Tiktok and realized I had missed how incredibly they handled the departure of Trevor. I think its a masterclass in succession planning and follow up. Some of the regular correspondents (Jordan Klepper, Desi Lydic, Josh Johnson etc) have now taken bigger roles and are taking turns in sharing their personalities and thoughts.</p>
<p>Its also amazing that Jon Stewart is back (my second favorite John, after John Oliver) is back and allowing the correspondents be at the front sometimes and almost equally. Its been done incredibly well and managed in a way that is not raising any eye brows or dropping the quality of the show and its content. I have no moral/prescriptive lessons (it should be obvious in the way this post has been written), just writing down this observation because its on my mind and there are some things to learn from it in business and in life as a whole.</p>
<p>Ciao.</p>
