Every new year we set goals, make plans etc. Some of us get thrown off halfway through the year, some people's plans do not last longer than the first month. I think its fundamentally because of how detailed we try to be with the goals and ideas for the year and we forget that we honestly only need to focus on the themes. The themes leave us with a good decision making framework that then guides what we accept and opportunities we chase that all ultimately leads to us being better off than we started (which is the whole point of new year's goals).

For me, I only have 3 north star metrics. 
1. Improvement in quality of life
2. Doing what I classify as fun (building products, trying to find people that love and enjoy using it and likely making revenue from it)
3. My person (that includes finding them)

Happy new year and I hope you get all you wish for.
Ciao.
